Models in Model-driven Engineering are primary development artifacts that are heavily edited in all stages of software development and that can become temporarily inconsistent during editing. In general, there are many alternatives to resolve an inconsistency, and which one is the most suitable depends on a variety of factors. As also proposed by recent approaches to model repair, it is reasonable to leave the actual choice and approval of a repair alternative to the discretion of the developer. Model repair tools can support developers by proposing a list of the most promising repairs. Such repair recommendations will be only accepted in practice if the generated proposals are plausible and understandable, and if the set as a whole is manageable. Current approaches, which mostly focus on exhaustive search strategies, exploring all possible model repairs without considering the intention of historic changes, fail in meeting these requirements.

In this article, we present a new approach to generate repair proposals that aims at inconsistencies that have been introduced by past incomplete edit steps that can be located in the version history of a model. Such an incomplete edit step is either undone or it is extended to a full execution of a consistency-preserving edit operation. The history-based analysis of inconsistencies as well as the generation of repair recommendations are fully automated, and all interactive selection steps are supported by our repair tool called ReVision. We evaluate our approach using histories of real-world models obtained from popular open-source modeling projects hosted in the Eclipse Git repository, including the evolution of the entire UML meta-model. Our experimental results confirm our hypothesis that most of the inconsistencies, namely, 93.4%, can be resolved by complementing incomplete edits. 92.6% of the generated repair proposals are relevant in the sense that their effect can be observed in the modelsâ€™ histories. 94.9% of the relevant repair proposals are ranked at the topmost position.

Models in Model-Driven Engineering are heavily edited in all stages of software development and can become temporarily inconsistent. In general, there are many alternatives to fix an inconsistency, the actual choice is left to the discretion of the developer. Model repair tools should support developers by proposing a short list of repair alternatives. Such recommendations will be only accepted in practice if the generated proposals are plausible and understandable. Current approaches, which mostly focus on fully automatic, non-interactive model repairs, fail in meeting these requirements. This paper proposes a new approach to generate repair proposals for inconsistencies that were introduced by incomplete editing processes which can be located in the version history of a model. Such an incomplete editing process is extended to a full execution of a consistency-preserving edit operation. We demonstrate our repair tool ReVision using a simplified multi-view UML model of a video on demand system, a screencast is provided at http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/SiLift/icse2018/.

In software development, models are used for system analysis and design. In model-driven software development, models are primary artifacts and the formal basis for the system implementation. A model is an abstraction layer which conceals the technical target platform. This increases the reusability of the developed components.However, this requires the definition of a formal syntax and semantics for the modeling language. Models are usually expressed from various viewpoints, e.g. the data structure and a user interaction. A multi-view modeling environment can be used to build complex system models. A viewpoint can also be constructed by slicing a specific part of the model. This can be helpful in distributing and processing large models across a development team. However, a developer can inadvertently introduce inconsistencies between different views. Ensuring the correctness of a model is a key task of the development process. Therefore, the developers need fully-fledged tool support to deal with inconsistencies.  This work presents an approach to the repair of inconsistencies in a distributed multi-view modeling environment. The introduced tool determines repairs based on user-defined edit rules. To understand the cause of an inconsistency, the repair algorithm considers the modifications which have introduced the inconsistency.
